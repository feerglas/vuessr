# vue-server-renderer rendering stencil webcomponents

Since we have some issues with nuxt ssr and stencil generated webcomponents (only when using slots), we want to investigate if the issue comes from vue-server-renderer.

Here ist the nuxt project which is trying to use webcomponents generated by stencil:

## Test it

To test the integration locally, make sure you have installed node version mentioned in `.nvmrc`:
```

npm start
```
